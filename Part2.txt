Now that you have successfully cloned and pulled your first repo (well... you probably pulled nothing since there were most likely no new files to actually pull...), we will begin learning to add and push files.

Begin by cloning the Beginners Sandbox repo. 

Once inside this folder, create a folder with your name, and inside, create a file Tutorial.txt

NOTE: You will be cloning whatever every other new person has uploaded to this repo as well. If you end up downloading for an extended period of time, someone most likely pushed a SQL dump or something pointless here. In the hopefully impossible situation where this might occur, remember that this is a shared repo by all of you and all of us.

Put whatever you want inside that text file, as long as you're not being a douche.

Now add the folder (and the file by extension) to the repo with git add.

You can 
$ git add * 
to add all files in the folder or use 
$ git add filename.ext
to add the specific file only. 

If it errors, please google or ask me how to fix it

You can use 
$ git status
to see which files have been added/changed/removed. Make sure that you only have what you want to upload before you commit.

After successfully adding, you will want to commit. A commit logs all changes to files - only insertions and deletions are taken into account in a commit. 

If using the command line, 
$ git commit -m "Message Here"
. If using the GUI, they may have a place to add a message. ALWAYS leave a message when committing, preferably something helpful and related to the commit. After this... 
$ git push

Pushing to github will send all of your changes from your computer to the main repo on Github.

If pushing fails, then once again, google or ask me how to fix it.

After this, we will move on to the third tutorial.
