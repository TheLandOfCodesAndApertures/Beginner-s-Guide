So, welcome to Github and the Land of Codes and Apertures! Starting off, you will first need to learn to clone this repository onto your local computer.

You may find this link helpful: http://gitref.org/creating/

Anyways, I suggest creating a directory specifically for Github stuff, and always using that same directory. 

To install GUI based git, please check out this link: http://git-scm.com/downloads

Note that all command line code will be prefixed by a $ but you should NOT include the $ when typing.

Now, use git clone in order to clone this repo to your computer. If using the command line, use the following:

$ git clone https://github.com/TheLandOfCodesAndApertures/Beginners-Guide.git

(The clone url is on the bottom right of the repo page)

After you have cloned it, try to git pull from inside the folder. If this fails, notify me.

After this, please begin the next part!
