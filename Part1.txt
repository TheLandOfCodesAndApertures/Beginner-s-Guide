Anyways, I suggest creating a directory specifically for Github stuff, and always using that same directory. 

To install GUI based git, please check out this link: http://git-scm.com/downloads

Now, use git clone in order to clone this repo to your computer. 

After you have cloned it, try to git pull. If this fails, notify me.

After this, please begin the next part!
